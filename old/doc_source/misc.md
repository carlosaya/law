## Problems

- Not easy to rebuild infra
- Hard to understand the infra architecture

## Features

- Minimal Repos per app. E.G. Code repo + CDK repo per app. (Could be less?)
- Auto Tagging and Logging for high level constructs
- Auto DNS names for services. (internal? lb ?) (able to hit internally first before public ?)
- Initial base pipeline to deploy application
- Blue Green deployment + Delayed/Approval based switch
- Easy rollbacks

## Objectives

- Enterprise Infrastructure
- Simple Deployments: Bootstrapping + Changes to the infrastructure.
- Libraries: High level CDK patterns
- AWS Native First
- Performance and Reliability
